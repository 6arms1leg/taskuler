# Timing table
# ============
#
# Type column
# -----------
#
# The `Type` column can take `p` (periodic) and `s` (sporadic) as values.
# Sporadic tasks are "made periodic" by assuming their shortest successive
# inter-arrival time as their period.
#
# Schedule column
# ---------------
#
# The following values are allowed in the `Sched.` column:
#
# * `co` - cooperative tasks
# * `pe` - preemptive tasks (with priority; nested interrupts)
#
# At least one `co` task must be present.
#
